I started competitive programming in 2013 with my first competition being [GCJ](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam) and was active until 2019 though my final competition was the 2020 world finals of [ICPC](https://icpc.global/)

Between 2013 and 2019 I solve ~6000 problems on different online judges and in different competitions with the largest share going to codeforces on which I solved 3600+ problems.

Like most competitive programmers, my main language is C++ though I use Java and Python as well.

My major acheivement in CP are:
1. Champion of the Egyptian Collegiate Programming Contest (ECPC) 2019
1. 2x Bronze Medalist of Africa & Arab Collegiate Programming Contest (ACPC) 2016 & 2019
1. 2x ICPC world finalist 2017 & 2020
1. 6x Chief Judge of the national competitions of MENA countries.
